**Situation:** You're building an e-commerce platform where users can add/remove items from their cart. Each item has a product ID, name, price, and quantity.

**Questions:**
- Which collection would you use to store cart items and why?
- How would you handle duplicate products (same product added multiple times)?
- If you need to maintain insertion order and also need fast lookups, what's your approach?
- How would you implement a "recently viewed items" feature with a maximum of 10 items?

**Follow-up:** What if you need to sort cart items by price while maintaining fast add/remove operations?
