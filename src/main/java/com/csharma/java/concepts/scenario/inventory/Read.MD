## 8. Inventory Management System

**Situation:** An e-commerce warehouse needs to track inventory across multiple locations.

**Questions:**

- You need to implement "reserved inventory" for items in shopping carts. What's your approach?
- How would you efficiently find products with low stock levels across all locations?
- For implementing product categorization with subcategories, which collection structure works best?

**Follow-up:** How would you handle concurrent inventory updates from multiple warehouse operations?
