## 3. Banking Transaction System

**Situation:** A banking system needs to process transactions and maintain account balances with strict consistency requirements.

**Questions:**
- You need to store pending transactions that should be processed in order. Which collection fits best?
- How would you implement a transaction history that allows fast lookups by transaction ID and efficient range queries by date?
- For implementing daily transaction limits per account, what data structure would you use?
- How would you maintain a list of recently blocked accounts that automatically removes entries after 24 hours?

**Follow-up:** What collection would you use for implementing a fraud detection system that needs to quickly check if a transaction pattern has occurred before?
