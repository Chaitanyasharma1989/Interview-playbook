## 4. Social Media Feed Algorithm

**Situation:** You're building a social media platform's news feed algorithm.

**Questions:**
- How would you store posts from followed users and sort them by engagement score (likes + comments)?
- You need to implement a "seen posts" tracking mechanism. What's your approach for memory efficiency?
- For suggesting "people you may know" based on mutual connections, which collections would you combine?
- How would you implement trending hashtags with real-time count updates?

**Follow-up:** How would you handle memory constraints when dealing with millions of users and posts?
