## 7. Task Scheduling System

**Situation:** You're building a job scheduler that needs to execute tasks based on priority and scheduled time.

**Questions:**
- Which collection would you use to store tasks that need to be executed at specific times?
- How would you implement priority-based task execution where higher priority tasks run first?
- You need to support recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly). How would you structure this?
- How would you handle task dependencies (Task B can only run after Task A completes)?

**Follow-up:** What if you need to support distributed task scheduling across multiple servers?
