## 5. Cache Implementation Scenario

**Situation:** You need to implement a custom LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for a high-traffic web application.

**Questions:**
- Which combination of collections would you use to achieve O(1) get and put operations?
- How would you handle cache eviction when the cache reaches its maximum capacity?
- What modifications would you make to implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache instead?
- How would you add TTL (Time To Live) functionality to cache entries?

**Follow-up:** How would you make your cache implementation thread-safe without significant performance degradation?
