## 6. Gaming Leaderboard System

**Situation:** You're developing a multiplayer game's leaderboard system.

**Questions:**
- Players have scores that change frequently. Which collection maintains sorted order efficiently?
- How would you implement a "top 100 players" view that updates in real-time?
- You need to show a player's rank and the 5 players above/below them. What's your approach?
- How would you handle multiple leaderboards (daily, weekly, all-time) efficiently?

**Follow-up:** What if you need to support millions of players with frequent score updates?
