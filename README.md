# Interview-playbook
Scenario based interview guide with implementation

## Expected Discussion Points for Each Scenario:

### Key Considerations Interviewers Look For:

1. **Time Complexity Analysis**: Can you explain the Big O notation for your chosen operations?

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Understanding of memory overhead for different collections.

3. **Thread Safety**: Knowledge of concurrent collections and synchronization strategies.

4. **Real-world Constraints**: Considering scalability, network latency, and hardware limitations.

5. **Trade-offs**: Understanding when to choose one collection over another based on use case.

6. **Performance Tuning**: Knowledge of collection initialization, load factors, and capacity planning.

### Advanced Follow-up Topics:

- **Custom Collection Implementation**: When and how to create custom data structures
- **Memory Leaks**: Common pitfalls with collections and how to avoid them
- **Garbage Collection Impact**: How collection choice affects GC performance
- **Serialization Concerns**: Collections in distributed systems and caching
- **Testing Strategies**: How to unit test collection-heavy code effectively

### Sample Answers Structure:

For each question, structure your answer as:
1. **Identify the core requirements**
2. **Choose appropriate collection(s) with justification**
3. **Discuss time/space complexity**
4. **Address potential issues and solutions**
5. **Consider scalability and edge cases**
